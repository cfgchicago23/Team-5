                    Join Rebuilding Together Aurora and Crossroads Church as we team up to serve those who have served and military families in the Fox Valley in honor of the sacrifices they have made to our country. Last year a record-breaking number of volunteers served more Veterans, military families and senior citizens than ever before and we are hoping to surpass those numbers in 2023.
